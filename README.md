# Village Winery 
A small,family owned business is producing quality wines and organising vine tasting tours. 
Due to remote location it occasionally might be difficult to discover this little hidden gem.
I decided to create a web site which will not only provide an online presence,
but will also help potential clients find the location easier, 
browse products and services offered which is aimed towards increase of the amount of visits
,bottles of vines sold and the owner's revenue. 
Previous customerâ€™s experiences will be available 
and lastly contacting the owner for any queries using the form provided.
